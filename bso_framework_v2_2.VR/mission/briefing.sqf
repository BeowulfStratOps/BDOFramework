// The system uses filters for setting who has been set a task or briefing.
// Included are the filters for sides in the Add Tasks section. These are the same filters which can be used in the AddBriefings section in the same way.
//
//   Task Entries
//		_taskID - REQUIRED. I.D. of the task used for scripting.
//		_description - REQUIRED. Full description of the task.
//		_title - REQUIRED. Title of task seen in the task list.
//		_shorttitle - REQUIRED?. Title seen on map if linked to markers, or 3d view.
//		_target - marker or object defined location of the task
//		_initial - Task status. For example "assigned"
//		_type - Type of task which dictates the icons used on the map and task list.
//
//
//	The following line is used to mark an objective as successful. Note how only the server calls the task change. More info can be found in the FHQ Guide.
//       if (isServer) then {["task1", "succeeded"] call FHQ_fnc_ttSetTaskState;};
//
// "<br/>" can be used to start new lines and create paragraphs
