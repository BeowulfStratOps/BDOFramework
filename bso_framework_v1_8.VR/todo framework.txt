-safestart as module
-init.sqf: show place for custom stuff

-separate acre/markers/briefing(/tasks)

-simple acre stuff:
 -move acre stuff all to simplified acre

 +channel setup as mission maker? meh. What for.

- make admin stuff more reliable / move it out of the mission makers handling
- properly integrate with admin addon

- make jip tp action toggleable as mission maker

+ ai scaling ?? Not sure how the framework could help with that

+ automatically delete markers ?? Sounds unnecessary and just annoying

disable ai simulation before gameon:
 how does that affect knowsAbout?
 Does this mess with any functions we use, e.g. jebus, cba_defend, garrison ?
  vehicles?
  drone ai?
  friendly ai?

- slow down time before gameon.

tp on gameon script? or trigger stuff? module even?
 more like a function to be called on gameon for people who didn't jip, or jipped before gameon. basciall whoever is in game when gameon happens.
 generic move to vehicle, move to (random) marker type script?


document stuff
cleanup indentation/newlines/bmf
